In the middle of 1997 forest fires burning in Indonesia began to affect neighbouring countries , spreading thick clouds of smoke and haze to Malaysia and Singapore . Then Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohamad searched desperately for a solution , and based on a plan by the head of the Malaysian fire and rescue department sent a team of Malaysian firefighters across to Indonesia under code name Operation Haze . This is to mitigate the effect of the Haze to Malaysia economy . The value of the Haze damage to Malaysian GDP is estimated to be 0.30 per cent . Seasonal rains in early December brought a brief respite but soon after the dry conditions and fires returned . By 1998 Brunei and to a lesser extent Thailand , Vietnam and the Philippines had also felt the haze from the smoke of the forest fires . By the time the 1997-98 forest fires were finally over some 8 million hectares of land had burned while countless millions of people suffered from air pollution .

The season was a relative success , with the club finishing second in the league , but they did not play in the UEFA Cup the following season due to the ban on English clubs in Europe after the Heysel Stadium disaster . They finished nine points behind champions Liverpool , who lost just twice all season and for much of the campaign looked uncatchable . Perhaps the most memorable game of the season was in the league at Anfield just before Liverpool 's title was confirmed , when United were 3 -- 1 down at half time but fought back to hold the hosts to a 3 -- 3 draw , denying them two points and delaying their bid to seal the title .   United lost just five times in the league in 40 games , and lost only once at Old Trafford , but a few disappointing draws against relatively unfancied sides including Charlton and Luton led to crucial points being dropped and prevented them from mounting a serious threat to Liverpool .   It was Alex Ferguson 's first full season as United manager , and it was the first season at the club for new signings Brian McClair -LRB- who finished the season as one of the First Division 's top scorers with 24 goals -RRB- and Viv Anderson . December also saw the arrival of defender Steve Bruce from Norwich City in a # 900,000 deal , after an approach for Rangers and England defender Terry Butcher collapsed when the player suffered a broken leg .   After the season 's end , Ferguson brought Mark Hughes back to Old Trafford from Barcelona in a # 1.8 million deal -- making him United 's record signing . He also replaced Chris Turner in goal by paying # 500,000 for Jim Leighton , who played under Ferguson at Aberdeen . He also attempted to sign Paul Gascoigne from Newcastle United , and a deal was agreed , but while Ferguson was on holiday , Gascoigne agreed to join Tottenham Hotspur in the first # 2 million fee to be paid by a British club .   It was the last season at United for long-serving defender Kevin Moran , who was transferred to Sporting Gijon after losing his place in the team to Steve Bruce . Remi Moses played his last game for the club before ongoing injury problems forced his retirement from playing , when still in his twenties .

It was 50 laps of the six kilometre circuit for a race distance of 290 kilometres .   The race was won by Brazilian driver Nelson Piquet driving a Williams FW11B . It was Piquet 's third and final victory for the year as he raced towards his third world championship . It was also the sixth consecutive victory for the Williams team , a run of wins that had begun at the French Grand Prix back in early July .

The resulting tsunami affected southern Chile , Hawaii , Japan , the Philippines , eastern New Zealand , southeast Australia and the Aleutian Islands .   The epicenter of this megathrust earthquake was near Lumaco -LRB- see map -RRB- , approximately 570 km south of Santiago , with Valdivia being the most affected city . The tremor caused localised tsunamis that severely battered the Chilean coast , with waves up to 25 m . The main tsunami raced across the Pacific Ocean and devastated Hilo , Hawaii . Waves as high as 10.7 m were recorded 10000 km from the epicenter , and as far away as Japan and the Philippines .   The death toll and monetary losses arising from this widespread disaster are not certain .

At the meeting , they first called their new league the American Professional Football Conference . A second organizational meeting was held in Canton on September 17 , adding more teams to the league . At the meeting , the name of the league became the American Professional Football Association . Four other teams also joined the Association during the year . Meanwhile , Jim Thorpe of the Canton Bulldogs was named the APFA 's first president but continued to play for the team .   Scheduling was left up to each team . There were wide variations , both in the overall number of games played and in the number played against other Association members . Thus , no official standings were maintained . In addition , football teams in the APFA also faced independent football teams not associated with the league . For instance , the Rochester Jeffersons played a schedule consisting mostly of local teams from their local sandlot circuit and the NYPFL , not the APFA .   The Akron Pros ended the season as the only undefeated team in the Association . Despite this , two one-loss teams -- the Decatur Staleys and Buffalo All-Americans -- who both tied Akron that year made cases for a co-championship .

It has been reported that the revival produced 100,000 converts .   The revival began in Kells and Connor in County Antrim . In late 1857 , through the encouragement of the minister of Connor Presbyterian Church , John Hamilton Moore , four recent converts began meeting in the Kells National Schoolhouse for prayer and Bible study . 1 January 1858 saw the first person converted as a direct result of the prayer meeting , and by the end of 1858 the attendance was around fifty . By Spring 1859 there were 16 prayer meetings in the parish . The revival spread to Ahoghill in March 1859 and then to Ballymena .   Although the revival started with laymen , revival preachers such as Henry Grattan Guinness and Brownlow North soon got involved . On one occasion North preached to 12,000 people at Newtonlimavady . James Bain , pastor of the Congregational church at Straid , described a typical Sunday during the revival in the following terms :  Our Sabbath services are continuous , from nine in the morning until ten at night . We are engaged from nine to twelve in prayer meetings for the young , from twelve to two in public service , from two to four in prayer meetings , from five to eight in the evening service , and finally in our evening prayer meeting .   The revival was a largely Presbyterian phenomenon , but not all Presbyterians supported it . William Gibson , Moderator of the Presbyterian Church of Ireland in 1859 , wrote a book about the revival called Year of Grace : A History of the Ulster Revival of 1859 .
